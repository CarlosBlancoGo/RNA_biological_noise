# RNA biological noise characterization through ageing in the mouse brain

## Overview

This repository contains the scripts used for the Masther's Thesis titled "RNA biological noise characterization through ageing in the mouse brain"

- Inside the "bash_scripts" directory are the scripts written in the Bash language, along with a JSON file containing the rules used to filter the long-read transcriptomes. These scripts primarily focus on obtaining SQANTI3-filtered classification files for downstream analysis.

- Inside the "r_scripts" directory are the scripts written in the R language. These scripts focus on data manipulation and analysis for the characterization of RNA biological noise in long-read transcriptomes from mouse brains, sequenced using PacBio and Oxford Nanopore.
