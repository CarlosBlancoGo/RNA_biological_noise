# RNA biological noise characterization through ageing in the mouse brain

## Overview

This repository contains the scripts used for the Masther's Thesis titled "RNA biological noise characterization through ageing in the mouse brain"

- Inside the "bash_scripts" directory reside the scripts written in bash language, along with a JSON file with the rules used to filter the long-read defined transcriptomes. These scripts mainly focus in the obtention of SQANTI3 filtered classification files for downstream analysis. 
- Inside the "r_scripts" directory reside the scripts written in R language. These scripts focus in data manipulation and analysis for the characterization of RNA biological noise in mice brains long-read defined transcriptomes sequenced with PacBio and Oxford Nanopore.
